                <blockquote><h3>From the very first pageant in 2009, Queens school pageant has always represented the highest of ideals: a combination of beauty, grace and intelligence; artistic and refined. Since then, Queens school pageantry has been a role model to both young and old alike; a spokesperson using her title to educate millions of Nigerians on issues of importance to herself and the society at large.

                    In years past, pageantry was a family affair; which is why we seek to bring back the family-friendly competition, reminiscent of a time when opportunity came with responsibility and womanhood was held in the highest regard.
                    
                    The Queens school pageant is one of the national pageant in Nigeria. Therefore, it forms a major part of our heritage showcasing beauty and the Nigerian woman. Both the Nation and the Competition share a special paralleling history.in 2009 Oluwakemi David was one of the many Guests of Honour at the Independence Day celebrations. been the first edition, showing the world that we could be governed autonomously.in 2009, Miss Joy Agbo being the very first Miss Queens school was given scholarships and other amazing gifts and recognitions.</blockquote>
